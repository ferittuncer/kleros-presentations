## The standard for Arbitra(tion/ble) smart contracts.

???
Welcome everyone, today we will go over Kleros' arbitration ethereum improvement proposal, which aims to standardize the way the demand side of dispute resolution (the arbitrable side) interacts with the supply side (the arbitration side).

The aim of the proposal is to provide a minimal interface by which any two conforming contracts can interact with each other to execute dispute resolution, regardless of implementation details. This way, dapps and their smart contracts can plug and play any contract that implements the standard. This will create a competitive market for arbitrators, which in turn will lead to better services, at lower prices, for consumers, all without additional development costs for any of the parties involved.

By the end of the presentation, you should have a clear understanding of how to develop smart contracts that adhere to the standard. OK, so let's get started.
